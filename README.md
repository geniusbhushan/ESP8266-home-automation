# ESP8266-home-automation
This project is an ESP8266-based home automation system that allows controlling up to four electrical appliances both via the Blynk mobile app (Wi-Fi control) and manually through latched physical switches. The ESP8266 connects to a 4-channel relay module, each relay acting as an ON/OFF control for a device like lights, or other home equipment.
